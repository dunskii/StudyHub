# StudyHub: AI-Powered Study Assistant

## Comprehensive Feature Overview

---

## 🎯 What is StudyHub?

StudyHub is an **AI-powered study assistant** designed specifically for Australian students (Years 3-12) and their parents. It's the first educational platform to integrate directly with the **NSW Mathematics curriculum**, providing personalised learning support that aligns with what students are actually learning in school.

Unlike generic study apps, StudyHub understands *where* a student is in their educational journey, *what* they should be mastering at their grade level, and *which* foundational skills from previous years might need reinforcement.

## 👨‍🎓 Features for Students

### 1. **Smart Note Processing**

| Feature | How It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Camera Capture** | Snap a photo of handwritten notes, textbook pages, or whiteboard content |
| **AI-Powered OCR** | Automatically extracts and digitises text from images with high accuracy |
| **Intelligent Organisation** | Notes are automatically categorised by subject and curriculum topic |
| **Searchable Archive** | Find any note instantly by searching keywords or concepts |

**Real-world scenario**: Sarah photographs her maths teacher's whiteboard explanation of quadratic equations. StudyHub extracts the content, identifies it as Stage 5 algebra (MA5.2-NA-01), and links it to related concepts she's already studied.

---

### 2. **Curriculum-Aligned Learning**

StudyHub maps every piece of content to the official NSW curriculum outcomes:

```

```

**Benefits**:
- See exactly what you're expected to learn at your grade level
- Identify gaps from previous years that might be holding you back
- Track mastery across all curriculum outcomes
- Prepare for assessments with confidence

---

### 3. **Personalised Spaced Repetition Revision**

StudyHub uses scientifically-proven spaced repetition to optimise memory retention:

| Session Component | Purpose | Time Allocation |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Current Grade Content** | Master new concepts | 40% |
| **Reinforcement** | Strengthen recently learned material | 30% |
| **Foundation Review** | Maintain essential prior knowledge | 20% |
| **Challenge Questions** | Extend thinking and build confidence | 10% |

**Adaptive Features**:
- Questions get easier or harder based on your performance
- Struggling topics appear more frequently until mastered
- The system learns *your* optimal study patterns
- Review reminders at scientifically-optimal intervals

---

### 4. **Socratic AI Tutor**

Instead of just giving answers, StudyHub's AI tutor guides you to understanding through thoughtful questions:

```
💬 Conversation with StudyHub Tutor
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You: I don't understand why 3/4 is the same as 0.75

Tutor: Good question! Let's think about this together. 
       If you had a pizza cut into 4 equal slices and 
       you ate 3 of them, what fraction did you eat?

You: 3/4 of the pizza

Tutor: Exactly! Now, if I told you that whole pizza 
       represents 1.00 (or 100 cents), and it's cut 
       into 4 equal parts, how much is each slice worth?

You: 0.25... or 25 cents?

Tutor: You've got it! So if each slice is 0.25, and 
       you have 3 slices, what's 0.25 × 3?
```

**Why Socratic Tutoring Works**:
- Develops independent problem-solving skills
- Creates deeper understanding (not just memorisation)
- Builds confidence in tackling new problems
- Mimics the best aspects of one-on-one tutoring

---

### 5. **Student Annotation Tools**

Take ownership of your learning with powerful annotation features:

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Highlighting** | Mark key concepts with colour-coded highlights |
| **Corrections** | Fix any OCR errors or add clarifications |
| **Personal Notes** | Add your own explanations in your own words |
| **Confidence Rating** | Flag topics you're unsure about for extra review |
| **Bookmarks** | Save important sections for quick reference |
| **Custom Flashcards** | Create your own study cards from any content |

---

### 6. **Gamification & Motivation**

Engagement without gimmicks—rewards that actually encourage learning:
