### Age-Appropriate Design Tiers

#### Years 3-6 (Stage 2-3) - Ages 8-12
```
- Large, colorful buttons
- Visual progress indicators (stars, badges)
- Friendly mascots/characters
- Simple navigation (max 3 levels deep)
- Lots of positive reinforcement
- Short session durations (10-15 min suggested)
- Minimal text, more visual cues
```

#### Years 7-10 (Stage 4-5) - Ages 12-16
```
- Cleaner, more mature design
- Progress tracking with statistics
- Subject-specific theming
- Peer comparison (optional, privacy-respecting)
- Longer sessions acceptable (20-30 min)

- Achievement systems
```

#### Years 11-12 (Stage 6) - Ages 16-18
```
- Professional, focused design
- HSC countdown and planning tools
- Detailed analytics and band predictions
- Minimal distractions
- Exam-focused features
- Study scheduling tools
- ATAR tracking
```

### Ethical Gamification Principles
```
DO:
- Reward genuine learning progress
- Celebrate mastery milestones
- Encourage consistent study habits
- Allow offline progress

DON'T:
- Use random reward mechanics (loot boxes)
- Create artificial urgency
- Punish for not using the app
- Make streaks feel mandatory
- Compare students negatively
```

### Parent Dashboard Philosophy
**Trust, not surveillance**

```
SHOW:
- Overall progress summaries
- Mastery of curriculum outcomes
- Study consistency (days active)
- Areas needing support
- Achievement celebrations

DON'T SHOW:
- Minute-by-minute tracking
- Keystroke logging
- Every wrong answer
- Comparisons to other children
```

### Student Privacy Considerations
```
- Students should feel safe to make mistakes
- Wrong answers are learning opportunities
- AI conversations are private (but logged for safety)
- Progress visible to parents is summarized, not granular
- No public leaderboards with real names
```

### Navigation Patterns

#### Student Navigation
```
